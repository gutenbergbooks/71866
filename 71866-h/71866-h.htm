<p class="poem">
  Ah! my blest Teacher, spare; my Strength is spent,<br>
  And was at best a Child's.  Some younger Voice<br>
  Excite; whose Song un-disappointed Hope<br>
  May help to heighten&mdash;Must I not refuse?<br>
  Dictate.&mdash;Howe'er discourag'd, lo! I speak<br>
  Once more, and trust in thy Almighty Pow'r.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WAR, Man-destroying, City-wasting WAR,<br>
  Fell, horrid, hellish, execrable WAR,<br>
  In rough, discordant Notes I mean to curse,<br>
  Not sing.  Can Harmony, and tuneful Sounds,<br>
  Agree with WAR'S mad Deeds, and hideous Din?<br>
  Willing, to others I resign the Praise<br>
  Of pleasing, while their Art its Horrors paints.<br>
  I seek to move Abhorrence of its Cause,<br>
  And Fears, while Indignation forms the Verse,<br>
  That should be writ with human Gore, not Ink;<br>
  Or with a Dagger's Point on human Bones,<br>
  In <i>Mars</i>'s Temples, Demon-God of War,<br>
  Pil'd, as in Charnels.  O! could I recount<br>
  The Numbers that his Flesh-devouring Sword<br>
  And Weapons have destroy'd, my Breath and Tongue<br>
  Would fail me to pronounce it: Could I show<br>
  Their Bones, on Piles assembled, they would make<br>
  Huge Mountains, scarce inferior to the <i>Alps</i>.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curst be the Man, that first his Hands imbrew'd<br>
  In Blood fraternal!  That dire Wretch was <i>Cain</i>:<br>
  He first, so early, shew'd, the human Soul<br>
  Could bear to hurt its Like, its second Self;<br>
  Which had not <i>he</i>, or some such Wretch, essay'd,<br>
  Could scarce have entred human Thought.  But Sin<br>
  Was the first Mover; <i>Eve</i>'s and <i>Adam</i>'s Sin<br>
  Slew <i>Abel</i>, All, whose Blood has since been shed.<br>
  From that dire bitter Root, sprang Murder, WAR,<br>
  And all our Evils: All had else been Peace,<br>
  And Love, and Joy, and everlasting Health:<br>
  O Fall from Love to WAR, from Heav'n to Hell!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curst too be <i>he</i>, some genuine Son of <i>Cain</i>,<br>
  Whose mischievous Invention hammer'd first<br>
  Rude Swords and Weapons!  Taught by whom, the rest<br>
  Apt Scholars all at Evil, dull for Good,<br>
  Study'd, and soon improv'd the hellish Art<br>
  Of hurting and destroying human Race!<br>
  While <i>he</i> most Praise obtain'd, who most advanc'd<br>
  The Mischief, and his Brethren most could hurt.<br>
  Offensive and defensive Arms were now<br>
  Their chief Delight, and all their Thoughts engross'd:<br>
  WAR'S murd'rous Implements increas'd apace:<br>
  Now the bent Bow was practis'd to dispatch<br>
  Wounds unforeseen, and sudden Hurt from far:<br>
  Now Death and Enmity see speedy Work<br>
  Were furnish'd: Now in Companies unite<br>
  The Sons of <i>Belial</i>, bent to spoil or slay<br>
  Their mild and peaceful Brethren; Men from Men<br>
  Appear'd not safe, unless completely cloath'd<br>
  In Steel, from Head to Foot: Amazing Change!<br>
  From naked Majesty to Skins of Beasts,<br>
  And now to Steel; yet horrider Disguise,<br>
  And monstrous!  How could <i>Adam</i> now have known<br>
  His Sons?&mdash;&mdash;But Steel itself too feeble prov'd<br>
  To fence from human Cruelty, and Thirst<br>
  Of Blood fraternal: And yet what more firm?<br>
  What could they use, when Steel appear'd too weak?<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Troop encounter'd Troop, and Hundreds fell;<br>
  These, <i>then</i>, were counted many to be slain<br>
  At once, and made a lamentable Tale!<br>
  Now mournful Families were all in Tears;<br>
  For her Espous'd the Virgin wept; her Son<br>
  The Mother wail'd; the Husband's Loss bemoan'd<br>
  His Widow, and her Children, destitute<br>
  And helpless, and without Resource but Heav'n!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What thought the while their primitive Sire, what said,<br>
  When he beheld his Offspring warring thus<br>
  In hostile Crouds, engag'd with mutual Rage<br>
  And Rancour in outrageous Deeds, and bent<br>
  To die, or to destroy, as if contriv'd,<br>
  By Nature's Will, of worst Antipathy?<br>
  How must his Love and Grief have interpos'd<br>
  Between their cruel Swords, and wildly cry'd,<br>
  'Sons!&mdash;Children!&mdash;why so furious, why this Rage<br>
  'And Thirst of Blood.'  What Madness urges you,<br>
  'Misrepresenting Objects?  They are all<br>
  'Your Brethren, your own Flesh, the Sons of <i>Eve</i><br>
  'And <i>Adam</i>; them, and not wild Beasts, ye hurt;<br>
  'Them, and sweet Charity, that on all Sides bleeds.<br>
  'I thought our Crime had introduc'd enough<br>
  'Of Death, and Evil; and ye, mad, contend<br>
  'Which shall increase it most, and do Death's Work<br>
  'Faster and better than himself, as hir'd<br>
  'By <i>Satan</i>, who beholds with great Delight<br>
  'Your Deeds, rejoic'd that Man is now become<br>
  'To Man, as fierce and sworn a Foe, as he.<br>
  'O, worse than me! unthinking <i>I</i> did Hurt<br>
  'To you: <i>Ye</i> study Malice, and can act<br>
  'Murder propense, and glory in the Deed!'<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little, may we suppose, did they regard<br>
  Their Sire's Reproof, who GOD'S Commands despis'd,<br>
  And Nature's Voice, which manifestly spake<br>
  Them Brethren, all from the fame Stock deriv'd;<br>
  All of one Blood and Flesh, so similar,<br>
  That each in each beheld another Self;<br>
  With plain Design, that nat'ral Sympathy,<br>
  And ev'ry thing, should draw them to unite;<br>
  Their very Form, like that of Doves, contriv'd<br>
  For Love and Friendship, not for Deeds of Hate;<br>
  And fitter to embrace, than hurt or kill;<br>
  Most other Creatures ready arm'd for Fight<br>
  With Horns, Hoofs, Claws, or Teeth, or Stings, or Beaks:<br>
  But Man was naked and defenceless left,<br>
  A Picture sweet of perfect Innocence,<br>
  By the rever'd Similitude of GOD<br>
  Impress'd, and native Majesty secur'd.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Grounds of Peace, all Reason, thrown behind,<br>
  Dire Love of WAR, like a Contagion, spread:<br>
  Those, that, so lately were but spoiling Bands,<br>
  Now to such num'rous Hosts increas'd, that Men<br>
  In social Multitudes, and Cities large,<br>
  Seem'd not secure, unless inclos'd in Walls.<br>
  Prodigious Heaps of pond'rous Stones were dug,<br>
  And brought with Labour vast: All Hands unite<br>
  For common Safety; All, industrious, urge<br>
  The necessary Work, till Walls were rais'd<br>
  Of Height and Thickness vast, esteem'd of Strength<br>
  Impregnable, insup'rable by Man;<br>
  Their heavy Gates of solid Brass, so firm,<br>
  As not to yield to less than Pow'r divine.<br>
  They now hop'd fearless to enjoy their own,<br>
  And sleep secure from Spoilers Swords: Vain, Hope!<br>
  The Murd'rers, to a mighty Host increas'd,<br>
  Approach, and with close Siege their Walls begirt.<br>
  *As an half-famish'd Troop of Midnight Wolves,<br>
  Pinch'd by bleak Winds, and chilling Rains, surround<br>
  A Flock of Sheep, safe-fenc'd; secure the Lambs<br>
  Bleat by their Mothers; they, excluded, rage,<br>
  To be debarr'd: Keen Hunger, and their Jaws<br>
  Long dry from Blood, to utmost Fury urge:<br>
  So these, prohibited Access, and foil'd,<br>
  Vexation, Rage, and foaming Spite consume;<br>
  Their cruel Ire could eat them all alive.<br>
  With resolute Patience long they wait, and hope<br>
  By Famine dire to conquer, whom their Swords<br>
  And Spears can't reach: Nor idle they the while;<br>
  But batt'ring Engines vast, and moving Tow'rs,<br>
  Their dev'lish Ingenuity, invents.<br>
  Mean time, streight Penury, and dismal Pine,<br>
  Hard presses the Besieg'd; forlorn Dismay<br>
  Sits on their meagre Faces; Bread is now<br>
  Than Gold more precious; Meat obscene, a Feast:<br>
  Yet they endure.  So dear is Liberty<br>
  To gen'rous Souls, than Life itself more priz'd!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All now prepar'd for gen'ral fierce Assault,<br>
  Dreadful approaches the blood-thirsty Foe.<br>
  By Penthouse cover'd, some, with Hammers large,<br>
  And massy Bars, their Gates attempt to break,<br>
  In vain: Some shake the bounding Wall with Beams<br>
  Of mighty Force and Weight, in hopes to cause<br>
  A Breach, while these at the Foundation try:<br>
  Others the crouded Battlements approach<br>
  In wooden, tott'ring Tow'rs, of equal Height,<br>
  Hoping by Bridges laid to pass from thence<br>
  To the near hostile Wall.  These Ladders fix,<br>
  And, cover'd with their Shields; to Death devote;<br>
  With desp'rate Valour mount; and with their Hands<br>
  Seize on the Summits; maugre all th' Efforts<br>
  Of the Defendants to prevent, repel,<br>
  And back precipitate with huge Stones, and Beams,<br>
  Torrents of boiling Pitch, and molten Lead,<br>
  Darts, Arrows, Spears, and Swords.  What dismal Work!<br>
  Horror stands horror-struck; Fiend <i>Mars</i> exults;<br>
  Yet wonders at his Sons!&mdash;<i>And what the Prize<br>
  Of all this desp'rate Intrepidity?<br>
  Immortal Life?</i>&mdash;It cannot be on Earth.<br>
  <i>The Glories, and Felicity of Heav'n?</i><br>
  That would indeed be worth all they could risk,<br>
  Or suffer: But, alas! Hell's only like<br>
  To be the Meed of such most hellish Hate,<br>
  Such dev'lish Cruelty, and Thirst of Blood.<br>
  Ill would such Creatures suit with Heav'n; the Seat<br>
  Of Peace, and Love perpetual: Such as they<br>
  Would soon convert its Glories to a Hell.<br>
  For hard'ned Clay, Dominion, Fame; for these<br>
  Without which Man may be as blest; they <i>this</i><br>
  Endure; and hazard horrid Wounds, and Death,<br>
  Yea, Hell, if Hell there <i>be</i>; a <i>Fable</i> deem'd!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wall is gain'd: They conquer: Now they mount<br>
  With eager Joy and Haste, no more restrain'd:<br>
  Now all is Slaughter, all infuriate Rage,<br>
  That neither sees, nor hears: The Sword devours<br>
  All in its Way; and spares nor Sex, nor Age.<br>
  The hoary Head, and little Infant, lie<br>
  Welt'ring in Blood; by whom the Mother bleeds,<br>
  Glad to die with it; wounded most in <i>that</i>.<br>
  If the fair Virgin 'scapes, she 'scapes for worse;<br>
  And shrieking begs for Death: In ev'ry Place,<br>
  Horror, Confusion, Cries, and Bloodshed reign:<br>
  Horrid Effects of wicked, wicked WAR!<br>
  The Carnage ended, and their Fury tir'd;<br>
  Their Heart reproves them not; they call themselves<br>
  Still Men; nor are asham'd to look at Heav'n.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few that 'scape the Sword's devouring Rage;<br>
  More wretched still, for worse reserv'd, are doom'd<br>
  To drudge in servile Works; rememb'ring oft,<br>
  With daily Sighs and Tears, their former Wealth;<br>
  Held vile as Beasts, and like them fed and us'd.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ev'n on the Town, the Victors wreak their Rage,<br>
  And burn its Gates and Palaces with Fire:<br>
  Now a vast Heap of Ruins: In its Rooms,<br>
  Once ceil'd with Cedar, soon wild Beasts will couch;<br>
  And Owls and Bitterns in its Windows roost.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were Mankind, from old primeval Time:<br>
  Giants, for Prowess fam'd, and mighty Deeds;<br>
  Whose Names and Fame have perish'd with themselves:<br>
  Indulgent Heav'n to these a longer Space<br>
  Allow'd; they might have Life enjoy'd in Peace<br>
  For Centuries, to near a thousand Years:<br>
  Yet chose in sanguinary Love of War,<br>
  To hazard losing such a noble Space;<br>
  Sev'n times as long as human Life is now.<br>
  For these, and other Crimes, the Race of Man<br>
  Was quite destroy'd (good <i>Noah</i>, and his Sons,<br>
  Except); and Earth from its Pollutions dire<br>
  Of ev'ry Sort, by gen'ral Deluge, wash'd.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heav'n now abridg'd the Term of mortal Life,<br>
  And to a Handful small our Days reduc'd,<br>
  To try, if when Existence was so short,<br>
  They would be chary of it; but in vain:<br>
  The dwindling Progeny of <i>Noah</i>'s Sons,<br>
  No better prov'd; but plunder'd, warr'd, and slew<br>
  As eagerly, as if they meant t' exceed<br>
  Their Fathers Sins; and hasten, by their own,<br>
  The last Purgation that's design'd, by Fire.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Nimrod</i>, the famous Hunter, first began<br>
  New Conquests' tir'd, at last, of hunting Beasts,<br>
  He turn'd his Cruelty to hunt Mankind,<br>
  As Beasts regarded; odious thence to God.<br>
  O let me Life support with Morsels begg'd;<br>
  A crippled <i>Lazar</i>, blotch'd with nauseous Sores,<br>
  Beheld with Pity by my MAKER'S Eye;<br>
  Rather than rule the Empire of the World<br>
  For Crimes and Cruelty, by HIM abhorr'd!<br>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Death had taught proud <i>Nimrod</i>, and Mankind,<br>
  How weak a Wretch the mighty Conqu'ror was;<br>
  <i>Belus</i>, his Son, not taught, inherited<br>
  His Empire, and his Cruelty and Pride:<br>
  By WAR'S perpetual, sought t'inlarge his Sire's<br>
  Extensive Conquests; nor could Limits set<br>
  To his Desires, insatiable as Death.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down from victorious <i>Belus</i>, deify'd;<br>
  And not esteem'd a Fiend, as he deserv'd;<br>
  Time's Archives with attentive Care evolve;<br>
  You hear of nought but WAR, accursed WAR,<br>
  In Act or Rumour, or its dire Effects;<br>
  Of the abhorrent Earth, with human Blood<br>
  Polluted; Cities fair and large, destroy'd;<br>
  To ruinous Heaps reduc'd; and Countries rich,<br>
  To Defarts alter'd; now by prowling Wolves<br>
  Possess'd instead of Men, whose wretched Race,<br>
  Curst, sanguinary Brutes, in Form of Men,<br>
  Have quite extirpated.  O Scenes of Grief<br>
  And Horror; odious, or to Sight or Thought!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving fast, this Second Race outvy'd<br>
  Ante-diluvian Cruelty: How much<br>
  Did these (tho' dressing hideous WAR in Pomp,<br>
  To hide its foul Deformity) increase<br>
  Its Horrors dire, and multiply its Woes?<br>
  These barb'd their dreadful Arrow-Heads; and dipp'd<br>
  In Juices venomous: A simple Wound<br>
  Too small a Mischief seem'd to satisfy<br>
  Their deadly Malice: These invented first<br>
  <i>Scyth'd</i> Chariots; as if Men were <i>Grass</i> indeed!<br>
  How many horrid Internments of Death<br>
  And Engines terrible, did these contrive,<br>
  Unknown to former Ages!  How improve<br>
  The <i>Trade</i> of killing Men!&mdash;The <i>lib'ral Art</i>,<br>
  I should have said; for WAR was <i>now</i> an Art;<br>
  And none in greater Credit; none esteem'd<br>
  Fitter for such as boasted noble Birth.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as this wicked World is now become,<br>
  None is more fit for <i>such</i> who should excel<br>
  In Magnanimity, as well as Wealth:<br>
  When WAR is unavoidable; I mean,<br>
  In Self-defence against invading Foes;<br>
  Then GEORGE, then <i>Cumberland</i>, by Heav'n approv'd,<br>
  Intrepid lead their animated Troops;<br>
  Then <i>Marlbro'</i>, then a hundred Heroes more,<br>
  Follow their glorious Chief; with <i>Him</i> resolv'd<br>
  To live or die: Yet, gen'rous, pity Those<br>
  They conquer; and had rather do them Good.<br>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these esteem'd WAR glorious, tho' unjust;<br>
  Were <i>Satan</i>'s Volunteers; and wilfully<br>
  Created, fought, abominable War;<br>
  And chose it for their Business, and Delight.<br>
  With these, all Arts, all useful Sciences,<br>
  All moral Excellence, Man's Glory, true<br>
  And only Heroism, were mean, compar'd<br>
  To the superior Praise of killing Man.<br>
  This was heroic Virtue deem'd; this thought<br>
  The noblest Way to gain immortal Fame;<br>
  This, their Historians celebrate, as Worth<br>
  Divine; this, flatt'ring Poets to the Skies,<br>
  To Heav'n itself exalt; and deify<br>
  Their Heroes false, more fitly, by themselves,<br>
  Sometimes compar'd to <i>rav'nous</i> Beasts of Prey.<br>
  Rapt, by the magic Sweetness of their Verse,<br>
  From due Reflection, Men with Pleasure hear<br>
  Of horrid Wounds and Death; which Souls humane<br>
  Should with Abhorrence think of, tho' deserv'd.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brutal Fierceness, by a vile Abuse<br>

  For Man was in GOD'S Image made; and GOD<br>
  Is Love; which therefore suits with Manhood best.<br>
  O! had their Heroes equal Courage shewn,<br>
  Protecting Innocence and Right, from Wrong,<br>
  And cruel Violence; in Defence of Truth<br>
  Oppress'd; in bearing the worst Ills of Life<br>
  With Fortitude heroic; had they, wise,<br>
  Rather subdu'd to Reason's Sway whate'er<br>
  Was vicious in their Souls; they then had Praise<br>
  In Truth deserv'd, and well been Heroes styl'd:<br>
  More truly, now, dire, bloody Murderers,<br>

  Suppose them now encount'ring: What <i>Le Brun</i><br>

  Ten thousand of their Species meet, and thus<br>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assemble, all ye Beasts, and Birds of Prey,<br>
  Lo, what a Feast the Cruelty of Man,<br>
  And WAR, provides you: Fill yourselves, devour;<br>
  But wonder, while ye feed, that Men should prove<br>
  More cruel, and more foolish Brutes than you.<br>
  Help ye to bury those whom no Man will:<br>
  No pitying <i>Tobit</i> these are like to find:<br>
  But ye, however willing, are too few:<br>
  Your Leavings, their half-eaten Carcases,<br>
  Abhorr'd by <i>you</i>, at last will putrefy;<br>
  And by their nauseous Stench endanger more<br>
  The Conquerors, than Living, by their Arms.<br>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On yonder Hill, see little <i>Rome</i> arise,<br>
  Unpromising, despis'd, and <i>bold</i>, to hope<br>
  Ev'n short Duration: That ere long will prove<br>
  The Queen of Cities; Martial <i>Rome</i>; as if<br>
  Its Founder were in Truth the Progeny<br>
  Of <i>Mars</i>; and spread its Conquests o'er the Earth.<br>
  A Race as bloody, as tho' all had fuck'd<br>
  Wolves, like their Founder; all, like him, been doom'd<br>
  To raise their City on their Brethrens Blood.<br>
  Fit Omen; well by the Event explain'd!<br>
  Woe to the <i>East</i>, and <i>West</i>, and <i>North</i>, and <i>South</i>,<br>
  Whose Sons <i>That Rome</i> shall sacrifice to <i>Mars!</i><br>
  Yet the pugnacious Brood, between themselves<br>
  Engag'd, shall oft revenge the injur'd World.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD could strike with various Plagues: But He<br>
  Abhorrence feels, in Mercy: HE could send<br>
  His Angels; they <i>obey</i>, not love the Task,<br>
  And pity while they strike: HE could employ<br>
  Foul Fiends for Executioners; but finds<br>
  Yet fitter Instrument; and sends a <i>Man</i>;<br>
  <i>He</i> loves it, and will do the odious Work<br>
  With Pleasure, and not tire; not nauseate Blood<br>
  At last; but like the Leech, still thirst for more:<br>
  An <i>Alexander</i>, <i>Cæsar</i>, <i>Kouli-Kan</i>;<br>
  Compared to these, a Fiend would be a Fool.<br>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KNOW, ye dire Pests, and Butchers of Mankind,<br>
  The greatest Conquest will be that of Death,<br>
  The glorious Crown of the MESSIAH'S Acts;<br>
  And this, by shedding his own precious Blood,<br>
  Without a Drop of other, will be won.<br>
  There, there, will be a Victor stain'd all o'er<br>
  With truly glorious Blood, the Blood of Love,<br>
  Of Godlike Love; not hellish Rage and Hate:<br>
  There will ye see a Hero, that all Praise,<br>
  Glory, and Altars, will indeed deserve,<br>
  For Millions sav'd, and not destroy'd: His Praise<br>
  From public Good, not public Hurt, will spring:<br>
  Who ne'er will take away a single Life,<br>
  Not one make wretched; but to Millions such,<br>
  To Myriads of such Millions, by his own<br>
  Sore Suff'rings, and free Off'ring of his Life,<br>
  Forfeited Happiness and Life restore.<br>
  You, <i>Ammon</i>, wept, that you had but one World<br>

  O come, be born, sweet Babe, the World's Desire,<br>
  In Hour auspicious, blest!  End, end your Wars,<br>
  Ye Nations, let no Clarions Sound disturb<br>

  Forgotten, let your needless Armour rust;<br>
  And break your useless Spears to feed the Fire.<br>

  That, oh! instead of better, they are worse;<br>
  They war like Heathens, and like Heathens live;<br>
  Yet Christians they <i>will</i> be, in spite of Heav'n,<br>
  Instead of Hell; for <i>this</i> such Saints approves,<br>

  Their Sword, the Spirit; perfect Righteousness,<br>
  Their Panoply divine; and Faith, their Shield;<br>

  Their Motive to subdue the World to Christ<br>
  And Happiness; their Aim, to bless their Foes<br>

  Against the shatter'd Walls, that at each Stroke<br>
  Tremble; a hundred pregnant Bombs, the while<br>
  Their cursed Globes, with Death and Mischief fraught,<br>
  Discharge, that drop like Comets from the Sky;<br>
  Too little all, without the Aid of Hell<br>
  In Mines beneath, that, like an Earthquake, Walls,<br>

  What worse has the just Ire of Heav'n denounc'd<br>

  Of Fiends?  Or, more to shame us, have they none!<br>
  Should peaceful Flocks of Sheep, with rabid Jaws,<br>

  Such Strangers to thy Spirit thou wilt hold<br>
  Strangers to thee, I fear; but where their Sin<br>

  To the Sea-roving Tribe, where, all at Peace,<br>
  In poor, half-naked Innocence and Love,<br>
  The Heav'n-taught, uncorrupted Nations dwell,<br>
  Dove-like; and think that Man can't murder Man?<br>
  <i>We</i> are the <i>Savages</i>.  The <i>Christians</i>, <i>These</i>,<br>
  In Love, at least; well-fitted to receive<br>
  The Gospel's Seed divine, and bring forth Fruit.<br>
  But, ah! what Isle so secret to escape<br>
  These Christian Murderers, with eager Scent,<br>
  Hunting for Gold all o'er the spacious Main?<br>
  When once they find us out, our peaceful Minds<br>

  Must be our Lot; while they, profane, presume<br>
  To name the GOD of Love, and talk of CHRIST.<br>
